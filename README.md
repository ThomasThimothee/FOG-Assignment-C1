# FOG-Assignment-C1

Technical review April 6:
  -Class diagram is ok
  -ER diagram was not normalized, we had to add a table that serves as "orderline".
  
 SCRUM review April 7:
  - We didn't have anything that we could demo, so he was a bit disapointed. The diagrams are useless for a "customer", the activity 
  diagram and domain model should have been done way earlier. Teachers also said that having the "complete" class diagram done is not 
  really scrum but more waterfall, we will probably change it so our focus on it might have been a waste of time.
  
 Next meeting: Scrum review on April 21.
  - We need to have something to show, a demo
  - when we give the version to demo to the teacher, we need the specify how it is used, for example if we don't specify that max length 
  or max height of a carport is X and Y, he will enter any values just to mess with our program...
